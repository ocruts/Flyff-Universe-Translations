There were once five beings of limitless power who, struck by a strange whim,
decided to create a world filled with magic and inexhaustible energy.
They gathered together and laid the foundations that would define the world they were to build.

-They created Water, so life could flourish-
-They created Wind, so life could breathe-
-They created Earth, so life could grow-
-They created Fire, to temper the souls of the world's inhabitants-
-They created Lightning, to remind those who gazed at the skies that they were not alone-

Life in the world known as Roika was prosperous for a long time.
Its inhabitants spread across the continent as the Human race flourished.
The Creators smiled upon the life they had shaped and continued to bless the people of Roika.

In time, Humans grew lonely and begged the Creators to grant them companions-
friends they could rely on in moments of hardship.
Answering their plea, the Creators brought the Dwarpets to life.
Together, Humans and Dwarpets shaped the world and lived in harmony
for many generations.

Eventually, the Creators grew weary of watching over the world they had made.
They prepared to leave Roika forever and return home.
Humans and Dwarpets begged them to stay.
"Sadly," the Creators replied, "we cannot. But we will leave someone to watch over you."
And so, the Creators brought forth Rhisis and entrusted her with the duty
of protecting all life on Roika.

Rhisis safeguarded the world for thousands of years, yet with each passing year, her loneliness deepened.
The pain of being left behind slowly consumed her heart.

#b-War of the Gods-#nb#nc

From three aspects of her own being, Rhisis created the Three Clown Gods.

She created Bubble, who embodied her joy and purity.
She created Shade, who embodied her fear and rage.
She created Iblis, who embodied her apathy.

Shade, feeding upon Rhisis' anger, sought to destroy Roika and all who lived upon it.
In her fury, she tore away a portion of the continent and cast it adrift.
She hoped the people stranded there would soon perish.

That severed land came to be known as Madrigal.
With the aid of the Dwarpets, the surviving Humans rebuilt their cities
and once again began to thrive.

Enraged by her failure, Shade created a race of monsters known as Masquerpets
and sent them forth to annihilate the people of Madrigal.
Hearing the echoes of battle far below, Bubble knew he could not remain idle.
He struck the Masquerpets with tremendous force, splitting Madrigal into
three great continents and scattering the Masquerpets across them.

Iblis watched - and did nothing.

Ancient tales speak of eight Heroes who rose against Shade and her Masquerpet army.
It is said they sacrificed their own lives to protect the people of Madrigal.

The people of Madrigal grew strong, yet they never forgot the friends and family
left behind on Roika.
They now train relentlessly to face Shade's Masquerpets, preparing for the day...
...when Shade returns to destroy them all.
